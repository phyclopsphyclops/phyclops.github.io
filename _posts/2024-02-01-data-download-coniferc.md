## Conifer (Picea abies) Sample Dataset
To request access to the full dataset send an email to phyclops at protonmail dot com. Note that this specific recording contains a lot of unwanted noise, but it can still be useful for getting a 'feel for the data', which is why I am making it available here. As of October 2024 there are many more different datasets for a variety of plants both potted and wild.
