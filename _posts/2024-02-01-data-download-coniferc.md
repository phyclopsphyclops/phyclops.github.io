## Conifer (Picea abies) Sample Dataset
[Download it from zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10557077)
To request access to the full dataset send an email to phyclops at protonmail dot com. Note that this specific collection of electrophysiology recordings contains unwanted noise, but it can still be useful for getting a 'feel for the data', which is why we make it available here. For details on what is being recorded see the included Readme file. 

As of October 2024 there are many more different datasets for a variety of other plants both potted and wild, indoor and outdoor.
