## Intro - Recording Electrical Signals of a Conifer in the Wild 
I am starting a long term electrical recording of a small wild conifer (Picea abies) in the austrian Alps. Electrophysiology and environmental data will be collected for one entire year. As of January 2024 a data sample is freely available for download (see the download section).
