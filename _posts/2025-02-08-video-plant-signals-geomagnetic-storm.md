## Plant Signals in a Geomagnetic Storm 
Question this experiment will answer:  
Can a geomagentic storm alter the electrical signalling patterns of a Conifer (Picea alba)?

We know that animal species can sense the earth's geomagnetic field. Many bird species use their magnetoreception 
for navigation. Some cetaceans such as dolphins and orcas also sense the magnetic field and use it
for navigating long distances through the oceans. It is believed that when geomagnetic disturbances (storms) ocurr
these marine mammals can temporarily lose their sense of direction. More recently it was shown that at least
one ant species uses the geomagnetic field as an additional cue for finding their way back to their nest.

Plants do not move and sensing the magnetic field may not give them any significant advantage in that regard, 
however since geomagnetic storms are mostly caused by abrupt changes in the particle flow and the spectral output 
of the sun and plants are very sensitive to different wavelengths of light, even if they don't sense magnetism 
directly they could be sensing the associated changes in light spectral composition and react to it, for example to
protect their sensitive photosynthetic machinery.
