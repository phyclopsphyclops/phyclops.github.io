## Indoor testing 
After calibrating two amplifier Version 4 boards and hooking them up to the microcontroller two new cases were
built. Unintentionally they turned out to look like Minions, which is why I am tempted to call them just that. 

The goal is to set them up over the next couple of days in a new field location. One will be connected to a 
douglas fir, the other one to a piece of dead wood as a control.
