## Electrical Signals of a dry-stressed Olive tree 
It is possible to detect the irrigation state (dry/irrigated) of an olive tree by analyzing the recorded electrical signals. It is important to note that this detection method can sense dryness well before it becomes apparent e.g. through wilted or discolored leaves, sagging branches etc.
