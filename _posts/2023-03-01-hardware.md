# Amplifier Version 2 - Schematic
This simple amplifier has two channels, each one requiring just two OpAmps, two potentiometers and one resistor. It is a DC voltage amplifier where the lower and upper bound of the input range can be adjusted, for example to -500 mV and +500 mV. It outputs a voltage between GND and VCC (3.3v). Before you build this yourself (it's not too hard) keep in mind that it will need to be [calibrated before its first use]() and it is also a good idea to put a 10k resistor between each output and the corresponding input pin of your ADC or microcontroller.

Note that this amplifier is supposed to be used with battery power only, because it has not filter to remove the usual 50-60Hz noise band.
