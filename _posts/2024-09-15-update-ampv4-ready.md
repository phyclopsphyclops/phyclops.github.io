## Amplifier version 4 is ready 
After a week of design work, 3-4 weeks of prototype testing on a breadboard connected to an Avocado plant the final design was sent out to the company doing the fabrication. Just three weeks later I received the five amplifier boards that I had orded and, to my great relief, they all worked as intended (phew).
