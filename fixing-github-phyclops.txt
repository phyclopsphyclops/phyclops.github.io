>>> Getting this error:
	The current runner (ubuntu-24.04-x64) was detected as self-hosted because the platform does not match a GitHub-hosted runner image (or that image is deprecated and no longer supported).
	In such a case, you should install Ruby in the $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE yourself, for example using 
		https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build

	You can take inspiration from this workflow for more details: 
		https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml
	$ ruby-build 3.1.4 /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64

	Once that completes successfully, mark it as complete with:
	$ touch /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64.complete

	It is your responsibility to ensure installing Ruby like that is not done in parallel.

Did this: and it seems to have worked:

	in  .github/workflows/build-jekyll.yml
	changed:  runs-on: ubuntu-latest      to        runs-on: ubuntu-22.04


	in	.github/workflows/jekyll.yml
	changed:  runs-on: ubuntu-latest      to        runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
